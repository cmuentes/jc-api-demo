#Demo Go Web API
This project contains a demo web API built in go. It currently uses a flat file structure. While I am experienced .NET and Node developer, I am new to go and this is my first attempt at a somewhat normalized API.

##Run The App
Just run `go run .` and the app will start correctly. Have fun!
